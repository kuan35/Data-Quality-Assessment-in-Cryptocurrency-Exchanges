# Data Quality Assessment in Cryptocurrency Exchanges: A Big Data Analytics Approach

This project utilizes big data analytics to evaluate data quality across cryptocurrency exchanges. By comparing price data from major platforms such as Binance, MEXC, and Bitget, it establishes a Data Quality Index (DQI) to quantify accuracy, consistency, and reliability.

This research is prepared for the 11th International Conference on Big Data Analytics (ICBDA 2026).
